1. What we would have liked to have seen is a justification for what subreddits were chosen, _period_.
2. All plots should have axes.
3. Had plots (+ points)
4. Are things running continuously?
5. Wrong Twitter API endpoint. using search api, should be using the 1% volume stream: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/volume-streams/introduction
